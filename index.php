			<p>I order the club sandwich all the time, but I'm not even a member, man. I don't know how I get away with it.
				How'd it start anyway? I like my sandwiches with three pieces of bread. So do I! Well let's form a club then.
				Alright, but we need more stipulations. Yes we do; instead of cutting the sandwich once, let's cut it again.
				Yes, four triangles, and we will position them into a circle. In the middle we will dump chips. Or potato salad.
				Okay. I got a question for ya, how do you feel about frilly toothpicks? I'm for 'em! Well this club is formed;
				spread the word on menus nationwide. I like my sandwiches with alfalfa sprouts. Well then you're not in the
				fuckin' club!

		<div id="payment" onmouseover="mouseOver();">
			<p>So it said "You can have this product for four easy payments of 19.95." I would like to have a product that was
				available for three easy payments, and one fuckin' complicated payment! We ain't gonna tell you which payment
				it is, but one of these payments is gonna be a bitch. The mailman will get shot to death, the envelope will not
				seal, and the stamp will be in the wrong denomination; good luck, fucker! The last payment must be made in wampum!

		<!--Doughnuts-->
		<p>I bought a doughnut and they gave me a receipt for the doughnut. I don't need a receipt for the doughnut.
			I'll just give you the money, and you give me the doughnut, end of transaction. We don't need to bring ink and
			paper into this. I just can't imagine a scenario where I would have to prove that I bought a doughnut. Some
			skeptical friend: "Don't even act like I didn't get that doughnut!
			I got the documentation right here...oh, wait it's at home...in the file...under "D".
